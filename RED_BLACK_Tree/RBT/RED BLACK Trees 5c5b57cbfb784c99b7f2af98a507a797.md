# RED BLACK Trees

A Red-Black-Tree is a binary search tree with one extra bit of storage per node: it's color (either RED or BLACK). By constraining the node colors on any simple path from the root to a leaf, red-black trees ensure that no such path is more than twice as long as any other so that the tree is approximately balanced. Indeed, as weâ€™re about to see, the height of a red-black tree with n keys is at most $2 lg(n + 1)$, which is $O(lg  n)$.

## Red-Black-Tree properties:

1. Every node is either red or black.
2. The root is black.
3. Every leaf (NIL) is black.
4. If a node is red, then both its children are black.
5. For each node, all simple paths from the node to descendant leaves contain the same number of black nodes.

## Rotations:

### Left Rotations:

1. The first step is the move the right-childâ†’left (x) to be the Pivotâ€™s right. If you are wondering why â€˜xâ€™ and not â€˜yâ€™ while rotating the tree must stay a binary search tree so the right child is definitely greater than the pivot, so the most accurate place to put the pivot in is the left of the right-child.

## Insertion:

1. insert the key first in the binary search tree with one extra thing (RED color),  every new key inserted is RED so the properties of the Red-Black_Tree can be violated.
2. fix the violation.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡  note:  the insertion can at most violate one rule.

</aside>

**case 1**: the tree is empty *(all good )*.

**case 2**: Parent is Black *(all good)*.

**case 3**: Parent is RED **( property 4 is violated)**

**case 3.1:** Uncle is RED 

1. set the color of parent and uncle to BLACK and grandParent to RED 
2. move node to the grandparent and repeat.

**case 3.2:** Uncle is BLACK

case 3.2.1: Parent is a right_child and node is a right_child.

  1. set the color of the parent to BlACK and the grandParent to RED.

1. Left-Rotate the grandParent.

case 3.2.2: Parent is a left_child and node is a left_child.

1. Set the color of the parent to BLACK and the grandParent to RED.
2. Right-Rotate the grandParent.

case 3.2.3: Parent is a right_child and node is left_child.

1. move node to the parent.
2. Right-Rotate node.
3. Set the color of the parent to BLACK and the grandParent to RED.
4. Left-Rotate the grandParent.

case 3.2.4: Parent is a left_child and node is right_child.

1. move node to the parent.
2. Left-Rotate node.
3. Set the color of the parent to BLACK and the grandParent to RED.
4. Right-Rotate the grandParent.

*Donâ€™t forget to reset the rootâ€™s color to BLACK at the End.*

## Deletion:

 

1. Delete the node following the binary search tree deletion, with some extra modification:
    1. save the color of the node to be deleted (original_color).
    2. if the node has only one child (or none) save the other (or TNULL) in a variable ( letâ€™s name it x). weâ€™ll see later why we need it.
    3. if the node has both children, the successor ( or predecessor) will replace the node with the original color, and now the node to be deleted is the successor (or predecessor), do â€˜aâ€™ and â€˜bâ€™ for the new node.
2. if the original_color is BLACK and the node x is also BLACK (we have a DOUBLE BLACK node) a black node is replaced with a black node, FIX IT.

### Explanation:

letâ€™s take an example and visualize it:

![delete1.png](RED%20BLACK%20Trees%205c5b57cbfb784c99b7f2af98a507a797/delete1.png)

![delete2.png](RED%20BLACK%20Trees%205c5b57cbfb784c99b7f2af98a507a797/delete2.png)

By deleting a RED node no property can be violated.

### **What if we delete a BLACK node?**

Itâ€™s called a double black node cause we replaced a black node with another black node, in other words, there are *fewer black nodes now on that subtree* which **violates** the **BLACK DEPTH property**, and we have a black node that we need to put somewhere else so we can have a balanced Red Black Tree again.

![delete3.png](RED%20BLACK%20Trees%205c5b57cbfb784c99b7f2af98a507a797/delete3.png)

![delete4.png](RED%20BLACK%20Trees%205c5b57cbfb784c99b7f2af98a507a797/delete4.png)

To solve this problem and Balance the tree, there are 4 cases (plus 4 which are just mirror cases)

to do so we need the sibling of the DOUBLE BLACK node (X which is BLACK as we said before), weâ€™ll call it W.

***keep one thing in mind we have an extra black we have to find for it a new place.***

### case 1: *W (sibling of X) is RED*

1. left rotate X.p so that node 65 can be the root.
2. set color of 65 to BLACK: the subtree of 65 still contains the same number of black nodes nothing changed.
3. make W the new x.p.right.

![delete5.png](RED%20BLACK%20Trees%205c5b57cbfb784c99b7f2af98a507a797/delete5.png)

But as you can see the **DOUBLE BALCK** problem still **exists.** but now itâ€™s a different case.

### case 2:

### W is BLACK, the furthest child; in our case the right child ( but in the mirror case it will be the left child), is BLACK, and the nearest child to X is RED.

![delete 6.png](RED%20BLACK%20Trees%205c5b57cbfb784c99b7f2af98a507a797/delete_6.png)

![delete7.png](RED%20BLACK%20Trees%205c5b57cbfb784c99b7f2af98a507a797/delete7.png)

in this case, we need to make the w.child the root, and as you see we need a double rotation to do so.

by doing these rotations w found a new place for the BLACK color and re-balanced the tree.

NOW What if the furthest child is RED?

### case 3:

### **W is BLACK, and the furthest child is RED, the color of the nearest child does not matter.**

![delete8.png](RED%20BLACK%20Trees%205c5b57cbfb784c99b7f2af98a507a797/delete8.png)

![delete9.png](RED%20BLACK%20Trees%205c5b57cbfb784c99b7f2af98a507a797/delete9.png)

left rotate x.p, push the extra BLACK  to x.p, and the RED fo x.p the node 57, and the BLACK of 57 to 

1. **TADA!**

one case left.

### case 4:

### W is BLACK, and both children are BLACK

1. Set the color of w to RED.
2. move the extra BLACK to X.p (if itâ€™s RED; all good) else itâ€™ll be one of the cases above.

**notes:**

cases (1,2,4) the problem may still exist, so you need to continue the balancing until x is the root

## Conclusion:

I tried to explain the idea of insertion and deletion from the beginning, and how to fix the balance. I didn't explain the code, because the code there on internet is very optimized, and itâ€™s hard to understand the logic behind it, I recommend starting by understanding how things work and writing the first version of the code (full of repetitions)  then go for the optimized version available

again

1.  **Insertion** â‡’ we try to remove one extra RED when it violates a rule
2.  **Deletion** â‡’ we try to remove one extra BLACK
